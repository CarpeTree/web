        <h1>Tree Pruning Services</h1>
        <p>Precision pruning that respects the tree's natural form and long-term health.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="service-content">
        <p>Pruning is a fundamental aspect of tree care that considers both the tree's life stage and its surrounding environment. Our approach focuses on cultivating strong branch architecture, mitigating potential hazards before they arise, and ensuring proper clearance from structures while maintaining the tree's natural beauty and vitality.</p>
        
        <div class="service-features">
            <h2>Structural Pruning</h2>
            <p>Structural pruning shapes the framework of a young or mature tree to ensure it grows with a sturdy, balanced form. Our tree care specialists selectively remove or shorten weak, crossing, or competing limbs to encourage one well-defined central leader and strong branch structure.</p>
            
            <p>Techniques like crown cleaning (removing dead or weak wood), crown raising (lifting low limbs for clearance), and tipping (reducing leverage on overreaching branches) are employed as needed to meet your tree's specific needs. We follow industry-recognized ANSI A300 pruning standards – meaning no "topping" or other harmful cuts that could injure the tree.</p>
            
            <h3>Why is structural pruning important?</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Stronger, Safer Trees:</strong> Proactive pruning prevents weak branch unions, reducing storm damage risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthier Growth:</strong> Improved sunlight and air circulation boost tree vigor and reduce pest/disease issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Future Costs:</strong> Early pruning minimizes the need for costly emergency removals later.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Local Considerations</h3>
            <p>The Kootenay's variable climate, with its mild, wet winters and dry summers, leads to vigorous tree growth. Without structural pruning, trees may become overgrown or hazardous. For example, codominant stems (two main trunks of equal size) are common in certain conifers and are structurally weaker due to frequently included bark, making them prone to splitting. Our science-backed approach includes techniques such as subordination pruning – gently reducing a co-dominant stem so that one leader dominates – to prevent splits in the canopy.</p>

            <h2>Fruit Tree Pruning</h2>
            <p>Fruit trees require a specialized pruning approach to maximize fruit yield while maintaining tree health. We prune fruit trees (such as walnut, apple, pear, plum, and cherry trees common in the kootenays) with a focus on creating an open, balanced canopy that allows sunlight to reach fruit-bearing wood.</p>
            
            <p>By thinning out dense clusters of branches and removing vertical "water sprouts," we help sunlight and air circulate, which improves fruit quality and reduces fungal diseases (a critical concern in our damp West Kootenays climate).</p>
            
            <h3>Our arborists are knowledgeable about proper fruit tree pruning techniques:</h3>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>Eliminating dead, diseased, or crossing branches to prevent pest spread and rubbing damage.</li>
                <li>Removing vigorous upright shoots (suckers and water sprouts) to direct the tree's energy into fruit production.</li>
                <li>Thinning the canopy to enhance air circulation, which reduces disease pressure and promotes better fruit development.</li>
                <li>Seasonal timing for maximum yield</li>
                <li>Balance of vegetative and fruiting growth</li>
            </ul>
