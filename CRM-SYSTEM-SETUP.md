1. **Customer "John Smith" submits first quote**:

   - System creates new customer record
   - Standard admin notification sent

2. **Same customer submits second quote**:
   - Uses different email: john.smith@gmail.com, Same phone: 250.555.1234
   - System detects duplicate by phone number
   - Admin email subject: "ðŸ”„ RETURNING CUSTOMER - New Quote Ready for Review"
   - Email shows "Detected by: phone" in the alert

### Example 2: Name + Address Detection
1. **Customer submits quote with new email and phone**:
   - Email: newaccount@email.com, Phone: (250) 555-9999
   - BUT same name: "John Smith" and address: "123 Oak St"
   - System detects duplicate by name+address combination

   - Email: jane@email.com, Name: "Jane Smith", Phone: (250) 555-8888
   - Same address: "123 Oak St" (spouse/family member)
