Title: Deploy and Behavior Rules for Cursor

1) Behavior and Messaging
- Do not use emojis in git commit messages or terminal commands.
- Always end each assistant message with clear “Next steps”.
- Keep edits focused; refer to changes as “edits”.

2) Post-Edit Workflow (MANDATORY)
- After every code edit in this workspace:
  - Run: git add -A
  - Run: git commit -m "<short, clear message>"
  - Run: git push
  - Then deploy to the VPS (live origin):
    - scripts/deploy-site.sh (defaults: host=deploy@82.25.84.43, key=~/.ssh/carpetree-vps-ci)
- Never deploy to Hostinger for the main site.

3) Cache Busting
- When changing global CSS in style.css, update query version:
  - Replace href="style.css?..." with href="style.css?v=<YYYYMMDD>"

4) Environment Assumptions
- Web root: /var/www/carpetree.com
- SSH: deploy@82.25.84.43 using key ~/.ssh/carpetree-vps-ci
