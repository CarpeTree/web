Decision Options Rule

When presenting 2+ implementation options to the user, always include a concise cost–benefit analysis:

- For each option, list:
  - Advantages (speed, reliability, security, UX)
  - Disadvantages/risks (maintenance, complexity, permissions)
  - Effort/time to implement
  - Reversibility (how easy to undo)
- Provide a clear recommendation and when to choose each option (e.g., quick fix vs. durable solution).
- Keep the comparison scannable with short bullets; avoid jargon.

This rule is additive to existing style rules (no emojis for git, etc.).
